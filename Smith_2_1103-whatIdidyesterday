Yesterday I had gone on the field trip to rackspace and learned that i know 
very little about networking, but i also learned about cisco has a developed 
away to manage swiches easy, faster, and it can be automated with code.
Then the guy that was supose to talk to us about API's ended up talking to use
about how to get a job in the industry by giting youself know by the community
and posting all your work on github. Then we got to do the speed dating thing
with the rackers and i learn how they got to work with rackspace and the 
things they do there and how to start up a linux network to practic my skills.
