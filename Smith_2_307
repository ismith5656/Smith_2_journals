What is the chain of custody?
 
Chain of custody (CoC), in legal contexts, refers to the chronological 
documentation or paper trail, showing the seizure, custody, control, 
transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic evidence.

How is it maintained?
  
To maintain the chain of custody for evidence collected during medical 
forensic examinations, label each item of evidence with the initials of 
everyone who handled it, the date, a description and source of the specimen, 
the name of the examiner, and the name of the patient. Also, make sure to 
address chain of custody in your SART's protocols or guidelines.
