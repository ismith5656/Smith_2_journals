           deb http://security.kali.org/kali-security kali/updates main contrib non-free
           deb-src http://http.kali.org/kali kali main non-free contrib

Then, run apt-get update

Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, openSUSE, Arch linux, Slackware Linux, and Puppy Linux
Enter the command apt-get update && apt-get install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r)
What happened? What is the purpose of this?
To make sure everything is up to date.
After the install is finished - in Kali type shutdown -r now
Remove the wireless dongle
After Kali restarts - type ifconfig and then uname -a
Insert the wireless dongle and pass it through using the virtualbox interface
After Kali AGAIN - type ifconfig
Do you see anything different for ifconfig or uname - either time in comparison to the start values at the beginning of the journal? Describe.
[If not - talk to Mr. Davis -- ESPECIALLY BEFORE ENTERING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CODE]T
The operating system version changed.
In Kali - enter the following code:


              apt-get install linux-headers-amd64 build-essential git checkinstall
              git clone https://github.com/porjo/mt7601.git
              mkdir -p /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
              cd ./mt7601/src
              make
              checkinstall -D make install #answer questions as you like. They don't need answers
              cp RT2870STA.dat /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
              modprobe mt7601Usta
                

Briefly summarize what you just did and why.
Type ifconfig - do you see anything different? Regardless of output - What does that mean?
If nothing has changed - you may need to follow the instruction in README_STA_usb 

After your device shows up:
iwlist ra0 scan
What did you see?
