How and why might you capture network data for forensic purposes?

Relating to security, involves monitoring a network for anomalous traffic 
and identifying intrusions. An attacker might be able to erase all log files 
on a compromised host; network-based evidence might therefore be the only 
evidence available for forensic analysis. Relates to law enforcement. In 
this case analysis of captured network traffic can include tasks such as 
reassembling transferred files, searching for keywords and parsing human 
communication such as emails or chat sessions.

Two systems are commonly used to collect network data; 
a brute force "catch it as you can" and a more 
intelligent "stop look listen" method.
