At Rackspace, the most important skills noted for achieving employment were 
problem-solving and active code development.

For example, presenters noted that they would be most likely to hire someone 
who goes home and spends hours working with Linux and networking.

Does that describe you? Why or why not?

Current that does not describe me because all of my electronics have been 
taken from me because I am failing this class and us history, because im 
currently a bit behind. But i plan on becoming that person who learns somthing new every day.
   
Similarly, presenters noted a demand for employees who were good at 
independent problem solving. Does that describe you? Why or why not?

I think so, I'm pretty good at finding away around a problem.

Have you finished your disk image? Why or why not? 

No, But I'm working on that now, because I got my VB running again.
